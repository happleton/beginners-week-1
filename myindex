I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

<br>

  <ol>
    <li>An opening list tag</li>
    <li>Many list items (&lt;li&gt;)</li>
    <li>A closing list tags</li>
  </ol>

<li>HTML is cool</li>
<li>CSS is cooler</li>
<li>JS is the best</li>


What do you need to create a website?

Not much!
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files
